# Here you can make static map cursors that appear independent of the map location.
# The format goes like the example below:
# The x and z can range from -127 to 126
# The direction is the rotation from 0 to 15
# The type is the cursor icon
# and the permission is what you need to see it, and it needs to be unique, so 2 cursors CANNOT have
# the same permission!
display:
    something:
        x: -64
        z: -64
        direction: 0
