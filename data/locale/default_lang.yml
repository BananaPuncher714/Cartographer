# If you want to make your own language file, you must include the three lines below.
# Your id is the internal name
# name is the one that gets displayed to players
# translate-color is whether or not to convert all '&' to the color symbol.
# Note that Clip's PlaceholderAPI already does this, so
# if the placeholderAPI is enabled, setting this to false doesn't do anything.

# And now here are the messages!
# You may notice that some of them have %0, %1, or %2. Those stand for the placeholders that will be in the message
# That means that it is going to be replace by something else.
# These messages also include the name of the inventories and items in the inventories.
# When creating your own locale file, you do not have to include all the messages, as
# Cartographer will use the default locale's messages that yours does not contain.
